# Blog for devHouse school 

This is the final project for DevHouse school I am going through. The project is dedicated to creating not a big blog using Vue js.

Technologies I am using here:

  FRONTEND: vue 2, scss, vue-router, vuex (some additional libs will be here if they are needed)
  
  BACKEND: Strapi (a good headless cms)
